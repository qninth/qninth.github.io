## Project Experience

### 1. Research Project - "Cell Library Pruning for Power Efficient ASIC"
> Period: *2020.02 - 2021.06*
  * This work explores the digital IC cell library pruning method. The pre-pruning of the standard cells before the synthesis overcomes the shortcomings of the current synthesis algorithm in the selection of the standard cells and can achieve a higher energy efficiency ratio after the synthesis. 

### 2.   Graduation Project - "Research and Implementation of Speech Enhancement Methods Based on Artificial Neural Networks" in Microelectronics
> Period: *2018.12 - 2019.06*

  * Utilized the TensorFlow-based Keras platform to train an improved RNN neural network.
  * Implemented a speech enhancement solution with reduced input-output parameter dimensions by applying human-like filter-bank processing to input speech signals and interpreting output signals as segment-based gains. Demonstrated significant noise reduction and achieved dimensionality reduction.
  * Developed an efficient C language model for forward inference using the trained Keras neural network. Successfully executed the program prototype on a computer and conducted relevant data tests.
  * Evaluated speech signal quality using segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and PESQ measurements, revealing significant advantages in low SNR conditions and improvements in speech quality with white noise and party noise.

### 3.   National College Students Electronic Design Competition - Ball Control System
> Period: *2017.07 - 2017.08*

  * Completed the inverted pendulum and windmill during the preparation period, and developed the ball control system during the competition.
  * Utilized basic control methods, including PID and Kalman filtering, and integrated flight attitude estimation algorithms to coordinate the MCU, electric devices, and sensors.
  * Implemented binary image compression and decompression algorithms in C language, and solved binary image recognition problems through dilation and erosion algorithms.
  * Implemented breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithms using queues and stacks, and computed connected domains to solve tracking issues with special points. Integrated connected domain weight and position characteristics for successful ball position recognition and tracking.
  * Utilized Git for version control and successfully resolved merge conflicts using the diff tool. Gained experience in small team development.

### 4.   Collaborative Team Project - "Analysis Report on the Microelectronics Industry"
> Period: *2019.02 - 2019.06*

  * Collaborated in a team to analyze the microelectronics industry. 
  * Gathered financial data of relevant companies and utilized Excel to analyze the industry's economic cycle sensitivity. 

### 5.   Graduation Project - "Relationship between Innovation-Driven Development Strategy and Import-Export Trade" in Finance
> Period: *2018.12 - 2019.04*

  * Utilized Stata to quantify macroeconomic data and developed empirical models to explore the relationship between innovation and import-export trade for enterprises.

## Professional Skills

* Passed the English CET-4 and CET-6 exams, and achieved Level 2 in the Computer Proficiency Test (C++).

* Proficient in programming with Python and MATLAB, with experience in object-oriented programming and C programming.

* Possess research experience in cryptography and have successfully implemented common algorithms such as DES, 3DES, and AES using MATLAB.

* Experienced in developing Tcl/tk GUI programs and have basic knowledge in creating websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Self-evaluation

* Actively participated in electronic design competitions throughout college and gained a strong foundation in coding. Has prior experience working in teams and collaborating on programming tasks.

* Possesses a solid understanding of relevant finance concepts and currently pursuing a graduate degree in the field. Demonstrates strong abilities in understanding, learning, and gathering information.

* Takes a serious and responsible approach towards work, ensuring the delivery of high-quality results. Effective communication skills aid in effectively conveying ideas and collaborating with others.
